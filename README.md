# Embedded Developer Interview Scripts

This repository provides a complete toolkit for preparing and running technical interviews for Embedded C++ Developer roles.

## Overview

The project offers resources for both interviewers and candidates, covering theoretical concepts and hands-on embedded development exercises.

### Key Contents

* **Practical C++ Tests**: Real code exercises (e.g., `cpp-race-condition`) to assess debugging and concurrency skills.
* **Technical Questions**: Collections focused on C++, memory management, pointers, and Git.
* **Automation**: Scripts that spin up interview environments quickly.
* **Documentation**: Detailed guides available through [GitHub Pages](https://andreferra.github.io/embedded-developer-interview/) or the `docs/` directory.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Source files for the static documentation site.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts that automate interview setup tasks.
- `cpp-race-condition/`: C++ source used for practical take-home or live exercises.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipelines that deploy the documentation and enforce quality checks.

## Usage

To start running the scripts or preparing the environment, read the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md).
